    <description>The relationship between Matters and Documents is one-to-many. Each legal case (Matter) can have a multitude of documents associated with it, including pleadings, evidence, correspondence, and other relevant materials. A Document typically pertains to a specific Matter, providing a clear organizational structure for case-related files. This relationship highlights the document-intensive nature of legal practice and the critical need to organize these documents according to the respective case they belong to. Every legal case generates a significant volume of documentation that requires systematic storage and easy retrieval.</description>
