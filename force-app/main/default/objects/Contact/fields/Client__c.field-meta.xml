    <description>The relationship between Clients and Contacts is one-to-one. A Client, within the context of Clio Manage, represents a specific role that a Contact plays in relation to a particular Matter. Every Client record will also exist as a Contact record in the system, but not every Contact is necessarily designated as a Client. This highlights a hierarchical relationship where Clients are a specialized subset within the broader category of all Contacts managed by the firm. While all clients are contacts, the reverse is not true; for example, opposing counsel would be a contact but not a client of the firm.</description>
